# CalyxOS

## Getting started

To get started with Android/CalyxOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

To initialize your local repository using the CalyxOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u https://github.com/CalyxOS-Lavender/platform_manifest.git -b android15-qpr2 --git-lfs
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```

CalyxOS is an AOSP based OS, built upon many free software projects. Check out the [website](https://calyxos.org/) to learn more about the project.

## Development

The [Building CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/docs/development/build/) page on our documentation covers in detail about how you can setup the environment and build your own copy of CalyxOS for a supported device.

Contributions to the project are always welcome. Please check out the documentation on [Gerrit Code Review](https://calyxos.org/docs/development/gerrit/) which covers the general setup and workflow.
